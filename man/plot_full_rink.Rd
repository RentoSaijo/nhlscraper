\title{Draw a full NHL rink using base graphics}
\usage{
plot_full_rink()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Called for its side effect of creating an
empty full-rink plot on the current graphics device.
}
\description{
\code{plot_full_rink()} opens a blank plotting region with NHL rink coordinates
and draws a full rink outline using base graphics. The centre line, blue
lines, goal lines, faceoff circles and creases, and rounded corners are
all drawn at NHL-standard locations (in feet, centred at centre ice).
}
\details{
The function sets up a square-aspect plotting window with x-limits
\verb{[-100, 100]} and y-limits \verb{[-43, 43]}, hides axes and labels, and draws the
boards and markings. It temporarily adjusts graphical parameters and restores
them on exit.

The coordinate system assumes the origin at centre ice, with the x-axis
running from one end board to the other and the y-axis running from side
board to side board. Distances are drawn in feet and are intended to match
common NHL rink dimensions.
