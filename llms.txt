## **nhlscraper**

nhlscraper is a minimum-dependency R package to scrape, clean, and
visualize NHL data via the NHL and ESPN APIs. It primarily wraps 150+
[endpoints](https://github.com/RentoSaijo/nhlscraper/wiki) from
high-level multi-season summaries and award winners to low-level
decisecond replays and bookmakers’ odds, making them significantly more
accessible. It also features cleaning and visualization functions,
primarily for play-by-plays, to help analyze the data.

### Prerequisite

- R/RStudio; you can check out my
  [tutorial](https://youtu.be/hGM1t6usDQ8) if you are not familiar!

### Installation

Install the official version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)
with:

``` r
install.packages('nhlscraper')
```

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('RentoSaijo/nhlscraper')
```

### Disclosure

Detailed documentation for each scraping function will be released
gradually over time. Because each function can return a large amount of
information, users are encouraged to explore the provided examples to
discover what is available. Most, if not all, of the endpoints accessed
by this package are unofficially documented (i.e., hidden), so it is
important to use them responsibly and with respect for the NHL’s data
servers. Endpoints serving historical or otherwise mostly static data
should ideally be queried once and then stored locally (for example, in
a MySQL database) for further analysis, rather than being called
repeatedly. The exact rate limits for these APIs are not publicly known,
so users are asked to avoid excessive or abusive querying to help ensure
continued access for everyone.

### History

Prior to the NHL API rework in 2023, Drew Hynes documented a
comprehensive list of known
[endpoints](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/), and several R packages,
such as [nhlapi](https://github.com/jozefhajnala/nhlapi) and
[hockeyR](https://github.com/danmorse314/hockeyR), were built to access
them. However, after the NHL completely transformed its API structure,
all of these packages became mostly defunct as their authors
understandably chose not to continue maintaining them. The community
gathered around work by Zachary Maludzinski to discover and share new
[endpoints](https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference), but progress
naturally slowed once most of the “main” endpoints were identified. Over
the summer of 2025, I began reverse-engineering many of the remaining,
undocumented endpoints while searching for additional data for future
research, with a particular focus on NHL EDGE and Records data. After I
shared those
[findings](https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference/issues/69), the
effort to expand and refine this map of the APIs accelerated, and
together, we ultimately identified 500+ new endpoints that expose a wide
range of NHL data. In parallel, I also discovered many new endpoints for
the ESPN API, extending beyond what Joseph Wilson had already
[compiled](https://github.com/pseudo-r/Public-ESPN-API).
