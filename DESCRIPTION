Wraps 125+ endpoints documented in <https://github.com/RentoSaijo/nhlscraper/wiki> from high-level multi-season summaries and award winners to low-level decisecond replays and bookmakers' odds, making them significantly more accessible. Features cleaning and visualization tools, primarily for play-by-plays.
